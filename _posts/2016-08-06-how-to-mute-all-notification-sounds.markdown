## My problem with the phone
I dont like my phone calling my attention for anything that is not immediate.
I like to hear only my calls and nothing else. For some reason Xiaomi in its
recent update removed the ability to make this possible for me.

I looked up for methods to do the same after the update. The only reliable app
which can do this needs the phone to be rooted. I did try rooting my phone and
I did not have a pleasant experience.

## My solution
I asked a friend of mine(Rahul from Samosa) to send a 1 second muted clip and changed messsaging and
notification tone to that. I hear nothing whenever there is a notification or
when there is a message (WhatsApp or otherwise)

Here is a link to the [one second muted mp3 file]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/muted_one_sec.mp3)

**next steps: Lots of problem seem to have this problem I should send them this
link and probably build my first android app using this idea"
