One of the important aspects of being good at solving business problems with tech
is to understand the scope and limitations of different technologies.

As a part of this I asked a friend of mine(Bracket) from HyperVerge who also happens to
the co-founder of the company to ask for introduction to machine learning.

The most common suggestion is to do the Andrew NG course on machine learning.

Given that I can code, I was looking for something more hands on.

1. [http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) - Hands on intro to machine learning
2. Tom Mitchel's machine learning  - A light weight but great book
3. [https://shapeofdata.wordpress.com/introduction/](https://shapeofdata.wordpress.com/introduction/) - Provides a very intuitive explanation of many machine learning techniques
