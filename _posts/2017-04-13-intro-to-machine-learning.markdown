One of the important aspects of being good at solving business problems with tech
is to understand the scope and limitations of different technologies.

As a part of this I asked a friend of mine(Bracket) from HyperVerge who also happens to
the co-founder of the company to point to resources which introduce machine learning.

The most common suggestion is to do the Andrew NG course on machine learning.

Given that I can code, I was looking for something more hands on.

1. [http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) - Hands on intro to machine learning
2. Tom Mitchel's machine learning  - A light weight but great book
3. [https://shapeofdata.wordpress.com/introduction/](https://shapeofdata.wordpress.com/introduction/) - Provides a very intuitive explanation of many machine learning techniques
4. Coding a simple ML algo: [Quora Answer](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-design-machine-learning-algorithms-from-scratch/answer/H%C3%A5kon-Hapnes-Strand?srid=ipLf)
5. General advice on Machine Learning: [Quora Answer](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-fast/answer/H%C3%A5kon-Hapnes-Strand?srid=ipLf)
