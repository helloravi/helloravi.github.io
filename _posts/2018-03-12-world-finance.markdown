The project is about addressing the finance of the human beings in the world. I am
calling the project Winance. WIN is the name of the coin.

## One pager
Access to capital is a very crucial tool to eliminate poverty and increase
productivity. How can we ensure that every human can get at least 10USD worth
of loan? If we can get them a small loan they will be able to get a bigger loan.
The number is not important.

An inclusive decentralized system where every participant starts with some coin
as soon as he/she does their KYC(after  ensuring that there is a reasonable
probability that it is not duplicate).

Loans disbursed in this system are a lot more safer than ordinary loans. Why is
that? Loan disburser can be sure that the money is being disbursed for the right
purpose by tracking where the loan amount is going. (Given an example)

There is an entire futures and options market place this opens up because of
this to keep this alive.

Coins get created when somebody does KYC. We ensure some inflation exists which
incentivizes players who attract other people to come and do their KYC and generate
their own KYC. We will need to involve people who verify other people's kyc and
contribute to the authenticity of KYC.

###### What are the benefits this offers?

1. It is inclusive. Everybody will want to be part of the financial system because
their KYC brings some cash and makes loans accessible to them.
2. It creates an ecosystem for finance guys to make money by being part of the
loan disbursing system (through offering options and contracts to those who want
  to give loans)
3. The coins accrue value whenever a company accesses the data of these people.
4. The data accumulated will hold a huge amount of long term value.
