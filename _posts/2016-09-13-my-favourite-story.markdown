This happend in ancient India. A man who is unable to tolerate the tantrums of
his wife and the burden of the family decides to become a "Sannyasi". In those
times divorce was not an option in India. "Sannyas" was misused as a way to get
 out of the family burdens in a respectable manner.

 Sannyasi is someone who spends his whole time on attaining realization or
 enlightenment. He leaves his family and travels to a forest to do his "tapas".
 Once he reaches the forest he realizes how comfortable his family life has been
 where he did not have to worry about food. He finds that it is a lot of work
 to gather and cook food for himself.

 With determination he continues doing his "tapas". One day he finds a wolf
 with both its front legs chopped off. To his amazement he finds that wolf looks
 well-fed. He wonders how the wolf has been able to hunt and fend
 for itself given its handicap. To find out how this is happening he hides himself
 behind a nearby stone and watches the wolf.

 To his shock he finds that lion walks in to the place where the wolf stays. He
 thinks to himself that the wolf is dead. Surprisingly, the lion actually brings
 meat and feeds the wolf. Looking at the whole situation the Sannyasi infers that
 this is a message from God. God is asking him to focus on his tapas and forget
 about the silly worry of feeding himself.

 Determined with the message from God, he completely ignores his hunger and just
 focusses on his tapas. Two days pass by and he is extremely hungy. Five days pass
 by and he is weak. Seven days pass by and he starts moaning. He does not have the energy
 to gather food and he cannot bear the hunger.

 A Yogi who is passing by hears his moaning and takes pity on him. He feeds
 this moaning man and enquires about his situation The Sannyasi narrates the
 whole story of the wolf and the lion and the message from God. The Yogi responds:
 "It is definitely a message from God. But why did you choose to be the crippling
 fox instead of choosing to be the generous Lion"
