One of the most powerful ways of going about implementing new features is play around them in test apps and later implement in the real project.

This delivers two benefits:
1. It allows us to focus on that particular aspect of the feature
2. It relieves us of the burden of overplaying on the real project. You only start implementing features once you think you have explored that particular aspect enough.

I am keeping this as a document for reference in the future. This lists source code links and details of the features I played around with.


###FAQ Chevron:
When I had to implement a collapsible FAQ which has a different type of chevron depending on whether the FAQ is closed or open.

AngularJs, Bootstrap collapse and collapse events are used to build this feature.
