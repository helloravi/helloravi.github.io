## Books are rated as tasted, swallowed, chewed and digested, can cook depending up on how well I have read them.

"*Tasted*" implies I have a good overview. "*Swallowed*" implies I have gone through and thought about
implementation details of some of the ideas. "*Chewed and digested*" implies I have gone through the implementation details of most of the ideas in the book. "*can cook*" implies I have read and referenced it multiple times.
