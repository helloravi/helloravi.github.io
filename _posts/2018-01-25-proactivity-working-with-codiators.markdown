***Pro-activeness*** is absolutely necessary. If you don’t have it, we don’t want you to be part of the team, You may be a nice person but we don’t want to work with you.

How does it translate on a day to day basis?


**Wrong thinking** -Nobody told me what to do so I am waiting and doing nothing.  
**Right thinking** - How do I find out what I should do? Should I ask Venky or Ravikanth?

**Wrong thinking** - I already asked  Ravikanth, he did not tell me anything  
**Right thinking** - how do I make sure Ravikanth tells me what to do? Should I call him again?

**Wrong thinking** - I have fever, I will wait for Venky and Ravikanth to call and find out.  
**Right thinking** - I will leave a message to them so that they are not concerned about it.

**Wrong thinking** - Ravikanth did not ask me. I did not tell.  
**Right thinking** - Over-communicate. Don’t make us guess.
