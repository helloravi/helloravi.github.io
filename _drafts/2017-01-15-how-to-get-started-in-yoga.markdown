## Benefits of yoga in work
The two direct benefits of yoga in work which I have observed are:
1. Realization that I am not busy. It is just that I am pre-occupied with a lot of thoughts. THis is not even day dreaming. Day dreaming is when you realize you are doing this.
2. Increasing the quality and duration of my attention.

Both these things lead to significant gains in productivity.

## How to get started

## What to expect
You will feel a little better during the day. You will see how much of time you spend pre-occupied.
