**Credits** - *My mother(for being extremely nosy about not wasting food), My babai(Vykunta Raju) for giving me insight into the mindset of people who need the food, Kedar for rekindling my thought back to this, The little shop at the bottom of the apartment, the article about some restaurant guy who put up a fridge outside so that it feeds other people.*


When I saw titles like that I used to assume that the solution has to be complex and sophisticated. Taking a step back and looking at these big problems makes me think if the solutions were complex and sophisticated they would have been solved a long time ago. The problems are big enough to attract a decent number of intellectually brilliant people looking at these problems.

Usually problems of this sort tend to find solutions in small insights. (Like the way vaccination was discovered). A series of incidents led me to come up with this solution.

## Incident 1
A little while ago I had a conversation with my babai(Dad's younger brother) who was
interested in doing some form of service after retirement. This comes up quite often
in talks within my family but I usually find that they are more interested in the  PR
generated rather than making an actual difference. This time it was different.

Babai: I am thinking of giving food to the needy to the poor in my birth village
after my retirement.

Me: Aha, How do you plan to do that? (thinking this is another PR idea)

Babai: Everybody tries to give food to people to eat right at the place they serve. That is
the wrong way to do it.

Me: Why?

Babai: People dont want to be reminded that they need somebody else's charity
to feed themselves.

Me: Cool. I never thought of it that way. What is a solution to that?

Babai: Well, you should give them parcels so that they can eat where they want to
and even share it with other people. Letting them choose their choice of location
makes them feel a lot more comfortable in taking the food. Also, the food gets to
the right stomachs if we do it this way.

## Incident 2
A friend of mine (Puneeth) forwarded an article about how a restaurant owner showed
a little bit of humanity which led to the following idea. He noticied people not
eating all the food they ordered and set up an open fridge outside his restaurent.
He asked his customers to leave the packed extra food in the refrigirator oustide
his restaurent. He let anybody and everybody take the food from the refrigirator.
If you are hungry and find food inside the refrigirator you can eat it.

## Incident 3
We recently shifted our residence to a place which is pretty close to the slums in that area.
The apartment has a small shop which is frequently visited by people living in those
slums. I noticed that if my mother wants a maid or help she goes to the shop owner
and tells her that she is looking for help. In a couple of days they usually end
up finding someone.

## Incident 4
I recently called Kedar (a friend of mine who is the founder-ceo of Hyperverge) to
get fundaes on how to set up a cook for our family.(Too many of us live at the same place).
Both of us do yoga and it is strongly suggested that we eat within 2 hours after the food
is cooked. Usually the guilt of wasting food makes us eat food from previous meals. Kedar
came up with an interesting solution.

Kedar went and bought a few aluminium foils which restaurants use to pack food when we get
a home delivery. He now packs up the extra food of everymeal while it is hot and gives
it to anyone whom he meets on the road. He says it usually takes up about five minutes
to find that person. This solves two problems for him. He does not have to eat food
cooked in the previous meal and he gets to help someone who is hungry.

## Solution
If the solution is fancy it wont get implemented. In Hyderabad,
if you get a parcel in the non-fancy restaurants they usually wrap it with
 a polythene-paper combination. Here is a simpler solution:


Take the extra food and pack it in the polythene-paper combination. Take a piece
of paper, write the date and time at which it is cooked and stick it to the parcel
using a cellophane tape. 




If you don't bother too much about whether the guy who is receiving it is grateful, you will
have be a lot more joyful doing this.
