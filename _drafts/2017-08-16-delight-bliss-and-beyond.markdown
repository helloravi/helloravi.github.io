I have been watching this video too many times. I thought it is a good idea to transcribe it so that I dont have to spend so much time re-watching it. I tried reading the captions from youtube did not like it that much.

Here is the transcript(correct me if I am wrong):
Invocation
Delight, Bliss and Beyond
All actions performed by the mind without attachment are non-actions.
And this performance is called performance with no-mind. This is called no-mind.
You may be performing all kind of activity in the world but without any attachment with the organs and with the respective objects, yet you are free.

This delight that we derive from the experiences of the senses from the respective objects is not abiding; it is fleeting. And again, if we repeat the same experience which has been now stored in memory, we need a desire earlier to call for this delight from the memory to have it again repeated, this delight is already past. Not a fresh one. Because we recalled from memory, we need first desire and then object of the desire to be experienced with the senses. Only unwise will have this repeated. The wise person will not do it because any experience that is fleeting he will not touch it.

All the beings in the world are unhappy. Not a single person is happy in this world because they all are delighting in the old experiences. No one asks for anything fresh. This is called delight. Let alone a common man. Even the kings, even having the precious diamond, yet the king needs "I want kohinoor". Anybody's desires are not fulfilled. There is one thing, one very precious thing, which is not stored in the memory will give you satisfaction, bliss and even something beyond. This is the topic of discussion today.

First of all no one gets out of this trap of delight. Everybody is trapped in delight. Then someone who asks for bliss and where is the bliss. Anything that is not called from the past memory is called bliss. No body could ever venture to investigate how to do it because this can be available by association with the sage(perfect person) who has known it and he can enable any person to have this experience. Or from the experiences of the ancients, already come into some authorized sutras. With the help of your own desire for abiding happiness(bliss) or call it freedom. It could be called Consciousness. There is nothing beyond Consciousness

If you attain Consciousness there is nothing more to be attained. Anything that can be attained would be lost. Having touched this Kohinoor, the diamond more precious, unattained by anyone so far. If you want something very fresh, very new, which is unattainable and undescribable. Why I call it unattainable is because:

Having attained it - the one experiencer, experience and the experienced(knower, known and knowledge) merge. Hence it is called attaining the unattaianable. This is called moksham, bliss, beyond. Some called it emptiness. Some call it fullness. It is beyond any words and has never been uttered so far. That has to be aspired for. You must aspire something which you have never heard from anyone before. Not it could be landed from memory, cant be seen, heard or touched or thought. When the mind blinks for a moment, everything rises. This manifestation is the result of just a blink of mind.

if you dont give a single stir of mind just for this instant, what I speak about is here and now. And my dear friends you are that. And you are that. And you are that. And if you have heard it and this world does not. .....
Somehow it has penetrated or tresspased into your memory. Fall in love with it. Be full devoted to it. Walking, talking, dreaming always get in touhc with it. Worship it. THis is the only subject or object or beyond that should be worshipped.

...
Everything is worshippable. Everything is that itself. What else could be there. If this is gold, you make anything out of this gold. You can make anything out of this. Its goldness cant be lost. Only name can be different. FOrm can be different. Like this everything....

ANything in the river - waves, bubbles - must be one substance must be water. IF you look at the bubble.

THis single instruction is quite enough for those who really deserved it for eons of yugas, kalpas and time. THis single hearing. For those if they like they can postpone it for an year or till this endd of incarnation. Why you are here and what for you are here. Just to know what you have been , future or present.

SOmehow you have lost track of it. Listen ...

If you dont, how long will this remain a trap. Somehow this trapness has to be resolved. One satsang is quite enough. Knowing this thing you are always in Satsang. Living as truth itself is satsang.

Who can say I am not the self? WHo knows I am the self is satsang? I am not the self. ... . Still excellent.

As the fish says. The flish is flying in water. I am thirsty. I am thirsty. If the fish can cry then it is alive. This is calles satsang.

There are no modifcations. IT is immaculate. who told you you are not pure? How can I am be impure? WHen you say I am it is enough. Only if you add something to it that is trouble. So here this time. Make the best of this time .Dont postpone. Postponement is manifestation.

Postponement is mind. I will do later. I will do tomorrowa. THen this mind. Past is memory. Memory is universe. Repitition of births and tensions. Even if you know ...

Because if you know I am suffering....

You are simply to know I am.

...

Can you show this "I am"? Just investigate and tell me where this "I am". YOu will not find I am anywhere. Only words. After sometime I am speaing this happiness. KNowing this is called equanimity, peace, bliss and before that was delight. Anything that is fleeting is called delight. ANything that is abiiding is not delight. HEre you are at peace.

....

Keeping upthis  for sometime in this state. And not desiring for anything from delight. YOu will be thrown or called by somewhere else into somewhere else. Only you have known waking, sleeping, dreaming.

.....

THree states we know. We have delight one. We have bliss in sleep state. Again we repeat this circle. And stayign here in this state. YOu will be called into somewhere else. States are only three. Beyond that you cannot call it state.

...

The sanskrit word is pragna. Beyod the beyond is called state. It is not even slef. It is not even it. Some sutras. It word it word is used. Tat word is used. That cannot be comprehended by mind.


For any kind of delight, bliss enjoyment.

Senses do not present themselves there. .....
When the breath retreat, that beyond is called called self. ...

Let beyond be beyond. I recieved many letters. Many

Having touched this kohinoor the diamond more precious than kohinoor.
If you want something unattainable.
